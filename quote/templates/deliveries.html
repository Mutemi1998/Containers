<li>All deliveries are made on a best efforts basis.</li>

<h3>Container Site Surveys</h3>
<blockquote>
<h5>Unfortunately due to Covid-19 Government guidelines, we are currently unable to carry out Site Surveys until further notice.</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you require a site survey to ascertain whether logistically a container/containers can be delivered to&nbsp;your premises? Have you restricted site access or have you a delivery time restriction? <strong>Fees are applicable</strong> for a site survey and are dependent upon location and time frame, please contact one of our team for further information or visit our <a href="/containers/container-site-surveys">Container Site Survey</a> page.</p>
